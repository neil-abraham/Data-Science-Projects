### Questions to Ask During Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Dataset Size and Structure:**
   - How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there?
   - What are the data types of the variables?
   - Are there any missing values or outliers?

2. **Summary Statistics:**
   - What are the measures of central tendency (mean, median)?
   - What are the measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range)?

3. **Patterns and Trends:**
   - Are there any correlations between variables?
   - Are there any seasonal patterns or trends over time?
   - Are there any clusters or groups within the data?

4. **Variable Distributions:**
   - Are the variables normally distributed?
   - Are there any skewed distributions?
   - Are there any bimodal or multimodal distributions?

5. **Relationships Between Variables:**
   - Are there any linear or nonlinear relationships?
   - How do different variables interact with each other?

6. **Anomalies and Inconsistencies:**
   - Are there any unexpected values or outliers?
   - Are there any data entry errors or inconsistencies?

7. **Comparison of Subgroups:**
   - Are there any differences between groups based on categorical variables?
   - Are there any differences between groups based on numerical variables?

8. **Identification of Important Variables:**
   - Which variables are most strongly correlated with the target variable?
   - Which variables have the most significant impact on the outcome of interest?

9. **Data Quality Issues:**
   - Are there any missing values that need to be imputed?
   - Are there any inconsistencies or errors that need to be corrected?

10. **Additional Data Considerations:**
    - Are there any additional variables that could be collected or incorporated into the analysis?
    - Are there any external datasets that could provide additional context or insights?
